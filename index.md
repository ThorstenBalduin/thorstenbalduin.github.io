Hi I am Thorsten Balduin and welcome to my website.<br>
I am currently a PhD student and part of the Chameleon Innovative Training Network.<br>
Thats means I am associated with two institutions, the IWF or Instistute for Space Research in Graz and the University of Copenhagen.<br>
With my two supervisors Peter Woitke and Uffe Grae Joergensen I am investigating the behavior of dust grains in protoplanetary disk.<br>
In particular we are investigating under which specific conditions lightning could emerge within protoplanetary disks.<br>
